# ASP.NET Core Identity Cassandra
[Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) data store adapter for [ASP.NET Core Identity](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/tree/main/src/Identity), which allows you to build ASP.NET Core web applications, including membership, login, and user data. With this library, you can store your user's membership related data on Apache Cassandra.  
Inspired by existing [AspNetCore.Identity.RaveDB](https://github.com/ElemarJR/AspNetCore.Identity.RavenDB) implementation.
